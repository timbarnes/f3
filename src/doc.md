# f2 Documentation

f2 is written and tested on MacOS, but does not use any MacOS-specific calls, so it should compile on Linux and Windows.
The implementation is a combination of Rust and Forth - the core capabilities are implemented in Rust, including the memory model, the compiler and interpreter, and a range of basic operations like arithmetic and stack operations. The Rust binary is just over 1Mb in size.

The data space is an array of i64, which stores all the words, contains the return and calculation stacks, and has space for additional data storage as needed.
Within Rust, the i64 values are cast to usize as needed.

Strings are stored in a separate array of chars, and builtin words are implemented through a separate jump table of function pointers.

Compilation results in the address of words being stored so the engine can simply jump to the code for any referenced word. For builtin functions, the address of the function pointer is stored, with a flag to indicate that it's a builtin function.

Because strings are stored separately, the names of words are captured in a single word address in data space, pointing into string space. Forth counted strings are used throughout (first 'character' is the length of the string).

Three string buffers are provided as follows:
* TIB - the text input buffer is the location where input is loaded for parsing, a line at a time.
* PAD - a working area where each token is placed after parsing. 
* TMP - a second working area where strings are staged before either being printed or embedded in a definition. or string variable.

The dictionary is a linked list, implemented directly in the data array, using back pointers to string words together like this:

n | n+1 | n+2 | n+3 | n+4 | n+5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
| back-pointer | name field | code field | args ... | back pointer | ...
| ..to previous word | points into string space | indicates word type | additional data for the word | points back to cell n |

So for example, a word defined as follows: `: double 2 * ;` would be stored like this:

n | n+1 | n+2 | n+3 | n+4 | n+5 | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| back-pointer | points to "double" in string space | DEFINITION | LITERAL | 2 | address of * | EXIT | back pointer | ... 
| points to the previous definition | also has "immediate" flag as required | indicates this is a `:` (colon) definition | indicates the next value should be pushed on the stack | the value to push on the stack | address includes a flag indicating `*` is a builtin | acts like a return, ending execution of this word | contains n (address of the next pointer back)

The builtin flag disinguishes between a builtin function accessed through the jump table, and a word defined in Forth. This lets the interpreter know to look in the builtin array for a function pointer, rather than looking in data space for a definition.

This system I believe is roughly equivalent to indirect threading, which allows a simple state-machine like function to step through a definition, executing words in sequence on the basis of their code addresses. When a new word is entered, the interpreter pushes a return address on the return stack. At the end of the execution of a word (or when the `exit` word is called explicitly), the return stack is popped and the program counter updated accordingly.

The definitions include their names, because the compiler is incremental. When a new word is defined in terms of other words, `find` is called to search back through the dictionary. Once found, we compile the address of the word, rather than the name. So interpretation is a matter of following address links, and all name searching is done at compile time. 

The inclusion of the names in the dictionary also supports the `see` operation, which decompiles user definitions, and provides basic documentation for builtin functions. Note that the decompiled version of a function is not identical to the original source code, because control structures (for example) generate branch code and insert that into the definition. This is one of Forth's superpowers. The engine only provides `BRANCH` and `BRANCH0` primitives. All the higher level control structures are implemented in Forth. The source code for these is in `corelib.fs`.

## Memory management and memory errors

Forth does not provide automatic memory management, and in general does not protect the user from illegal memory accesses. It should therefore be understood that once the dictionary or any data the program uses is corrupt, all bets are off, and a restart is usually indicated. Within the Rust code, the compiler does its best to protect the programmer, however Forth allows any address to be passed to store and load (`!`, `c!`,`@ and `c@`) words, so it's easy to cause a panic on bounds violations. Fortunately the binary is small, and startup is quick, so it's not generally too much of a problem.

I may add my own bounds checks to the store and load words, but this will not eliminate all crashes, because many memory accesses occur inside the Rust engine, and a corrupt dictionary, for example, can and will cause problems. There might be a couple of approaches to fixing this:
* Add macros for store and load that do their own bounds checking and cause a Forth `abort` rather than a Rust panic
* Create my own panic handler that looks for bounds errors specifically and runs `abort` rather than crashing the program.

Note however that neither of these solutions are really enough, because in most cases the bad load or store is the result of a bug that may well have corrupted the dictionary, so recovery may still be impossible.

## Future work

The current regression test suite is quite weak. It only examines stack results. Implementing the standard test harness

# Builtin Words

This is not intended to be full documentation, but a reference to the stack behavior and basic functions of some important words to help with debugging. f2 supports most of the standard stack and arithmetic words.

see | \<word> | The Forth decompiler. If \<word> is a builtin, see provides the documentation for that word. If it's a user-defined word, see provides the source code as compiled. This is often different from the original source code, because control structures are compiled down to lower level branch functions, and are not represented in their original form.

## Timing and Delay
To time a function, precede it with `now` and follow it with `millis` or `micros`, which will place the elapsed time on the stack.

## Debugging

A single stepper and trace capability allows for viewing interpreted functions as they execute. When active, it prints a visual indication of the depth of the return stack, the contents of the stack, and the word being executed.

The single stepper responds to single character commands (followed by Enter):
* `s` => take a single step
* `t` => shift to trace mode
* `c` => continue - turn the stepper off
* `i` => step in (increase stepper-depth)
* `o` => step out (decrease stepper-depth)
* `?` or `h` => print help information
